# Road Accident Severity Analysis Using Linear Regression

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use a linear regression model to analyze and predict road accident severity based on several factors like speed, weather, and road conditions.

### How to Use
1. Open the provided `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Follow the steps to train the model and use it for predictions.
3. Modify the dataset or example predictions as needed.

### Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

### Example Prediction
See the code for a real-life example of predicting accident severity. Modify the example to test other scenarios.

### Benefits for Underdeveloped Countries
Traffic accident analysis models like this can provide insights for improving road safety, managing traffic, and designing infrastructure.
